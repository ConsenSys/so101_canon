## Defining Self-Organization
**Accountability**: A sense of responsibility in individuals and groups to follow agreements. Agreements are the legislation which govern the rules of how a team or organization operates.<br>
<br>
**Role**: A clearly defined and mutually exclusive area of responsibility. Roles can be filled temporarily or permanently, typically by a single individual.<br>
<br>
**Agile**: Agile is a product and project methodology in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing and cross-functional teams. There is a bias towards incremental improvement and iterative learning through short (typically daily or 1-2 weeks) sprint cycles. [more information here](https://www.cprime.com/resources/what-is-agile-what-is-scrum/)<br>
<br>
**Holacracy**: A structure and way of operating an organizing with power distributed throughout an organization. This gives individuals and teams more freedom to self-manage, while staying aligned to the organization’s overall purpose. [more information here](https://www.holacracy.org/what-is-holacracy)<br>
<br>
**Sociocracy**: Sociocracy, or dynamic governance, is a governance system that aims to create healthy social environments, which lead to productive organizations.<br>
<br>
**Teal Organizations**: This paradigm views the organization as an independent force with its own purpose, and not merely as a vehicle for achieving management's objectives. Assigned positions and job descriptions are replaced with a multiplicity of roles, often self-selected and fluid. People’s actions are guided not by orders from someone up the chain of command but by ‘listening’ to the organization’s purpose. [more information here](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Teal_Organizations)<br>
<br>
**Child-Parent Paradigm**: A Child-Parent paradigm exists between two individuals when one individual holds a clear higher position than the other in the power dynamic. <br>
<br>
**Adult-Adult Paradigm**: An Adult-Adult relationship exists between two individuals when one individual holds equal position in the power dynamic than the other. <br>
<br>
**Governance**: Governance in SO organizations are made through a set of agreements. These agreements are the legislation which govern the rules of how we operate. <br>
<br>
**Stewardship**: Stewards are facilitators of roles. Stewards look after your relationship with the group, your one guaranteed point of contact for each role. Stewards are responsible for carrying out each role and recruiting other individuals to help with the completion of tasks related to a role.
